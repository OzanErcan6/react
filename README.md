# Technologies I have learned and used are:  
React Components  
React Virtual DOM  
React Router  
Controlled and Uncontrolled Forms  
Redux (Actions, Reducers, Dispatch, Thunk)  
json-server,
Fetch (GET,POST Requests)  


# Installation Steps: 

git clone https://github.com/OzanErcan6/react.git  
cd react  
npm install  
npm start  
  
# Running the json-server  
Open a new terminal  
cd json-server  
json-server --watch db.json -d 1000 -p 3001  
  
now everything should be working :)
